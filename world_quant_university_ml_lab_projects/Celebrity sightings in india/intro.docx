in this project, you'll learn how to perform face detection and recognition tasks by using a video of an interview with Indian Olympic boxer Mary Kom. You'll use a state-of-the-art pre-trained Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Network (MTCNN) model together with Inception-ResNet model to perform face recognition. The goal is to use selected video frames of Mary Kom and her interviewer and create a face embedding for each of them. This will allow you to detect their faces on new images. You'll conclude the project by wrapping your code into a Flask app that allows a user to upload an image and perform face recognition.

Some of the things you'll learn are:

How to use a pre-trained MTCNN and Inception-ResNet V1 models from facenet_pytorch
How to obtain face bounding boxes and cropped faces using MTCNN
How to create face embedding using Inception-ResNet How to construct a library of known face embeddings
How to determine if an image contains a face from the library of known faces
How to build a Flask app
